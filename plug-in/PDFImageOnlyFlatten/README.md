This sample shows how to create a Win2PDF plug in to automatically merge multiple layers of a PDF into a single layer and save as a "PDF Image Only (color)" PDF.  This provides additional protection against document counterfeiting.

The Win2PDFImageOnlyFlatten.iss [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) script creates a setup program that can be used to install the plug-in.

This plug-in uses the [Win2PDF command line](https://www.win2pdf.com/doc/win2pdf-desktop-command-line.html) to [print to an image only PDF](https://www.win2pdf.com/doc/command-line-print-pdf.html).  Contact support@win2pdf.com for a time limited evaluation license.
