# Attach a PDF created by Win2PDF to an Outlook Email   

This sample shows how to create a Win2PDF plug-in to add an option to send a PDF created by Win2PDF using Outlook.  The plug-in uses the [NetOffice components](https://github.com/NetOfficeFw/NetOffice) to interface with the Outlook API.

The Win2PDFSendToOutlook.iss [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) script creates a setup program that can be used to install the plug-in.

The plug-in requires that [Win2PDF](https://www.win2pdf.com/download/download.htm) is installed.
